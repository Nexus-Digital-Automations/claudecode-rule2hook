## üí° Tips for Contributors

### Understanding the Architecture

claudecode-rule2hook is intentionally simple:

1. User invokes `/project:claudecode-rule2hook`
2. Claude receives the prompt from `claudecode-rule2hook.md`
3. Claude analyzes rules and generates hooks
4. Claude saves configuration to `~/.claude/hooks.json`

No external dependencies or complex logic needed!

### Testing Your Changes

1. Clone your fork locally
2. Make changes to `.claude/commands/claudecode-rule2hook.md`
3. Test with various rule inputs
4. Verify generated hooks work correctly

### Common Patterns

When adding support for new rule patterns:

1. Add detection logic to the prompt
2. Include examples in the prompt
3. Add test cases
4. Update documentation
