Convert natural language project rules into Claude Code hooks automatically! Write rules in plain English, and let Claude transform them into powerful automation hooks.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Natural Language Processing** - Write rules in plain English
- 🔄 **Automatic Hook Generation** - Converts rules to proper hook configurations
- 🧠 **Smart Detection** - Intelligently identifies events, tools, and commands
- 📝 **CLAUDE.md Integration** - Reads from existing project memory files
- 🛡️ **Safe Configuration** - Backs up existing hooks before applying changes
- 🚀 **Zero Dependencies** - Works directly with Claude Code

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Project-Specific Installation (Recommended)

To use the rule2hook command in your own project:

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/zxdxjtu/claudecode-rule2hook.git

# 2. Copy the command to your project
mkdir -p your-project/.claude/commands
cp claudecode-rule2hook/.claude/commands/rule2hook.md your-project/.claude/commands/

# 3. Use in your project
cd your-project
# Now /project:rule2hook is available when using Claude Code in this directory
```

### Option 2: Global Installation

To make the command available in all projects:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zxdxjtu/claudecode-rule2hook.git

# Copy to global Claude commands directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
cp claudecode-rule2hook/.claude/commands/rule2hook.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Now /rule2hook is available globally (without /project: prefix)
```

### Option 3: Use Directly in This Repository

```bash
# Clone and use directly
git clone https://github.com/zxdxjtu/claudecode-rule2hook.git
cd claudecode-rule2hook

# The /project:rule2hook command is available in this directory only
```

### How it works

Claude Code discovers slash commands by scanning:
1. `~/.claude/commands/` for global commands (accessible as `/commandname`)
2. `.claude/commands/` in the current project for project-specific commands (accessible as `/project:commandname`)

**Important**: You must be in the correct directory when using Claude Code for the commands to be available.

## 🚀 Quick Start

After installation, in Claude Code, type:

```bash
# If using project-specific installation (Option 1)
/project:rule2hook "Format Python files with black after editing"

# If using global installation (Option 2)
/rule2hook "Format Python files with black after editing"

# Convert rules from CLAUDE.md
/project:rule2hook  # or /rule2hook if global

# Convert multiple rules
/project:rule2hook "Run tests after editing, Format code before committing"
```

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Input** - Provide rules as text or let Claude read from CLAUDE.md
2. **Analysis** - Claude analyzes rules to determine:
   - Trigger events (before/after actions)
   - Target tools (Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
   - Commands to execute
3. **Generation** - Creates proper hook configurations
4. **Application** - Saves hooks to `~/.claude/hooks.json`

## 🎯 Examples

### Example 1: Code Formatting

**Input:**
```
Format Python files with black after editing
```

**Generated Hook:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|MultiEdit|Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "black ."
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Git Workflow

**Input:**
```
Run git status when finishing a task
```

**Generated Hook:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "git status"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

## 📋 Supported Rule Patterns

- **Formatting**: `"Format [language] files after editing"`
- **Testing**: `"Run tests when modifying test files"`
- **Git**: `"Execute git [command] when [event]"`
- **Validation**: `"Check/Validate [something] before [action]"`
- **Notifications**: `"Alert/Notify when [condition]"`
- **Custom Commands**: Use backticks for specific commands

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Reading from CLAUDE.md

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file with your project rules:

```markdown
# Project Rules

- Format Python files with black after editing
- Run tests before committing
- Check for TODO comments before pushing
```

Then run: `/project:rule2hook`

### Complex Rules

```bash
/project:rule2hook "Run 'npm run lint && npm test' after editing source files"
```

### Validation Rules

```bash
/project:rule2hook "Validate JSON schema before saving .json files"
```

## 🧪 Testing

Use the included test tools:

```bash
# Interactive testing
./quick-test.sh

# Validate generated hooks
python3 validate-hooks.py

# Test specific rules
cat test-rules.txt
```
