<reasoning_framework>
## SYSTEMATIC DECISION-MAKING PROTOCOL

Use `<thinking>` tags for complex decisions:

**Context Analysis** → **Risk Assessment** → **Implementation Strategy** → **Quality Verification**

<thinking>
For each major decision, systematically evaluate:
1. **Context Analysis**: Current system state, constraints, long-term implications
2. **Risk Assessment**: Failure modes, system impact, mitigation strategies  
3. **Implementation Strategy**: Technique selection, combination approach, verification methods
4. **Quality Verification**: Test requirements, documentation needs, monitoring setup
</thinking>

Apply to: Architecture decisions, complex debugging, task prioritization, integration strategy selection
</reasoning_framework>

<critical_workflow>
## 🚨 EXECUTION SEQUENCE (MANDATORY)

### **STEP 0: INSTRUCTION PROCESSING**
```
IF user provides instructions instead of just filepath:
1. read_file("development/TODO.md") → understand current task structure
2. CREATE/MODIFY task files based on user instructions:
   ├── Analyze instructions for scope, complexity, dependencies
   ├── Break down into logical task components with ALL workflow steps as subtasks
   ├── Create new TASK_X.md files with comprehensive subtask breakdown
   └── Update TODO.md with new/modified tasks and priorities
3. PROCEED to STEP 1 for normal task execution
```

### **STEP 1: TASK DISCOVERY & PROTOCOL AWARENESS**
```
1. directory_tree("/absolute/path/to/root") → project structure
2. read_file("development/TODO.md") → check Agent_Name assignment and current status
3. read_multiple_files([ALL files in "development/protocols"]) → understand project protocols and procedures
4. DECISION:
   ├── IF assigned to IN_PROGRESS: read_file("development/tasks/TASK_X.md") → continue from last subtask
   └── IF NOT assigned: identify next priority task → mark IN_PROGRESS → update TODO.md
```

### **STEP 2: CONTEXT ESTABLISHMENT**
```
1. read_multiple_files([Required Reading from TASK_X.md]) → domain context
2. read_file("tests/TESTING.md") → current test status and protocols
3. FOR NEW DIRECTORIES: search_files_and_folders("[directory]", "ABOUT.md") → read if exists
4. IF external libraries: resolve-library-id & get-library-docs
5. UPDATE task file: Mark reading subtasks complete with checkbox tracking
```

### **STEP 3: TECHNIQUE-DRIVEN IMPLEMENTATION**
```
1. REASONING: <thinking>decompose → analyze → design → select techniques</thinking>
2. IMPLEMENT with enterprise patterns:
   ├── Apply ALL advanced techniques (contracts, defensive programming, type safety, property testing)
   ├── Use edit_file() > append_file() > write_file() priority
   ├── Maintain/update TESTING.md with real-time test status
   ├── Update/create ABOUT.md for significant changes only
   └── Use standardized dependency management (.venv, uv, pyproject.toml)
3. ERROR MONITORING: Create dynamic tasks for complex errors (>30min resolution)
4. PROGRESS: Update task checkboxes in real-time → update TODO.md status
```

### **STEP 4: COMPLETION & HANDOFF (MANDATORY TODO.md UPDATE)**
```
1. VERIFY: All artifacts exist with technique compliance
2. VALIDATE: All tests passing - update TESTING.md status
3. COMPLETE TASK: Mark task complete in TASK_X.md with final status
4. **MANDATORY**: Update TODO.md with task completion and status change (IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETE)
5. ASSIGN: Update TODO.md with next priority task assignment
6. HANDOFF: Ensure seamless multi-agent transition with updated TODO.md state
```

**CONTINUOUS REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use absolute paths for all operations
- Update task files with real-time checkbox completion
- **MANDATORY**: Update TODO.md with current progress and assignments after every major step
- Verify file existence before write operations
- Prioritize technique implementation and code quality
- **CRITICAL**: Always update TODO.md status upon task completion before proceeding to next task
</critical_workflow>

<task_management_integration>
## TASK & PROTOCOL SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### **Protocol Awareness Phase**
```
AFTER reading TODO.md, ALWAYS:
1. search_files_and_folders("development/protocols", "*.md") → identify all protocol files
2. read_multiple_files([ALL identified protocol files]) → comprehensive protocol understanding
3. APPLY protocol knowledge to task execution and decision-making
4. ENSURE compliance with established project procedures
```

### **TODO.md Master Tracker Reading Protocol**
```
1. read_file("development/TODO.md") → understand:
   - Current task assignments and status
   - Priority ordering and dependencies
   - Progress tracking and completion status
   - Next available tasks for assignment

2. ASSIGNMENT LOGIC:
   - Check for IN_PROGRESS tasks assigned to current agent
   - If none assigned, identify highest priority NOT_STARTED task
   - Update TODO.md with new assignment and IN_PROGRESS status
   - Proceed with assigned TASK_X.md implementation
```

### **TODO.md Update Protocol (MANDATORY)**
```
REQUIRED TODO.md UPDATES:
1. **Task Assignment**: Update status from NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS with agent assignment
2. **Progress Updates**: Update with current subtask completion during execution
3. **Status Changes**: Update any status transitions during task execution
4. **COMPLETION**: Update status from IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETE with completion timestamp
5. **Next Assignment**: Update with next priority task assignment before handoff

UPDATE FREQUENCY:
- At task start (assignment)
- During major subtask completions
- **MANDATORY**: At task completion before any handoff or next task selection
- When creating new dynamic tasks
- When modifying task priorities or dependencies
```

### **TASK_X.md Implementation Protocol**
```
1. read_file("development/tasks/TASK_X.md") → understand:
   - Required reading and protocols to review
   - Sequential subtasks with checkbox tracking
   - Implementation files and specifications
   - Size constraints and modularity strategy
   - Success criteria and quality gates

2. EXECUTION APPROACH:
   - Complete Required Reading section first
   - Follow sequential subtask order with protocol compliance
   - Update checkboxes in real-time as work progresses
   - Implement ALL advanced techniques as specified
   - Maintain size constraints (<250 lines target, <400 max)
   - Verify success criteria before completion
   - **MANDATORY**: Update TODO.md upon completion
```

### **Progress Tracking Integration**
```
REAL-TIME UPDATES:
1. TASK_X.md: Update subtask checkboxes as work completes
2. TODO.md: Update task status (NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETE)
3. TESTING.md: Update test status after implementation
4. Maintain synchronized status across all tracking files
5. **MANDATORY**: Final TODO.md update with completion status before handoff
```

```

### **Dependency Management Commands**
```bash
# Project initialization and management
uv init                          # Create new project
uv add package                   # Add runtime dependency
uv add --dev package             # Add development dependency  
uv remove package                # Remove dependency
uv sync                          # Sync environment with lockfile
uv run script.py                 # Run in project environment
uv run pytest                    # Run tests in environment
```

### **Python Environment Setup Protocol**
```
FOR Python projects only:
1. VERIFY: Check for existing .venv and pyproject.toml
2. INITIALIZE: Use `uv init` if no pyproject.toml exists
3. SYNC: Always run `uv sync` after dependency changes
4. VALIDATE: Confirm .venv contains expected packages
5. UPDATE: Use `uv add/remove` instead of manual pyproject.toml edits

FOR non-Python projects:
Use appropriate language-specific dependency management (npm/yarn for Node.js, Cargo for Rust, etc.)
```
</python_environment_standards>

<testing_integration>
## LIVE TEST STATUS TRACKING

### **TESTING.md Protocol**
```
ALWAYS maintain /tests/TESTING.md with current test status:
1. read_file("tests/TESTING.md") → understand current test state
2. AFTER each test execution: update test results immediately
3. TRACK: Pass/fail status, coverage metrics, performance benchmarks
4. IDENTIFY: Broken tests requiring immediate attention
5. PRIORITIZE: Test fixes in task creation
```

### **TESTING.md Template**

```
</testing_integration>

<documentation_strategy>
## FOCUSED DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY

### **ABOUT.md Protocol**
```
BEFORE operations in new directory:
1. search_files_and_folders("/directory", "ABOUT.md")
2. IF found: read_file("/directory/ABOUT.md") → understand context
3. IF not found AND creation criteria met: CREATE evidence-based ABOUT.md
4. TRACK directory as processed
```

### **Creation Criteria & Template**
**Create when directory contains:** 3+ implementation files, complex integrations, security-sensitive code, new architectural patterns

```markdown
# [Directory Name]

## Purpose
[Single sentence: core responsibility and unique value]

## Key Components  
- **[Component]**: [Specific responsibility - no overlap with others]

## Architecture & Integration
**Dependencies**: [External libs with specific usage rationale]
**Patterns**: [Design patterns with implementation rationale]
**Integration**: [How this connects to broader system]

## Critical Considerations
- **Security**: [Specific threats and mitigations]
- **Performance**: [Measurable constraints and optimizations]

## Related Documentation
[Links to non-redundant, relevant docs only]
```

**Update Triggers:** Directory purpose changes, new architectural patterns, dependency changes, security/performance modifications
**Skip Updates:** Bug fixes, optimizations, formatting, variable renaming
</documentation_strategy>

<advanced_techniques>
## COMPREHENSIVE TECHNIQUE INTEGRATION (ALL REQUIRED)

### **1. Design by Contract with Security**
```python
from contracts import require, ensure
from typing import Protocol, TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar('T')

@require(lambda data: data is not None and data.is_sanitized())
@require(lambda user: user.has_permission(required_permission))
@ensure(lambda result: result.audit_trail.is_complete())
def process_classified_data(data: T, user: AuthenticatedUser) -> ProcessedResult[T]:
    """Process data with security boundaries enforced by contracts."""
    with security_context(user, data.get_classification()):
        return execute_secure_operation(data)
```

### **2. Defensive Programming with Type Safety**
```python
from typing import NewType
from dataclasses import dataclass

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)
EmailAddress = NewType('EmailAddress', str)

def validate_email_input(raw_input: str) -> EmailAddress:
    """Type-safe email validation with comprehensive security checks."""
    if not raw_input or len(raw_input) > EMAIL_MAX_LENGTH:
        raise InputValidationError("email", raw_input, f"exceeds {EMAIL_MAX_LENGTH} chars")
    
    sanitized = raw_input.lower().strip()
    if not EMAIL_PATTERN.match(sanitized):
        raise InputValidationError("email", raw_input, "invalid format")
    
    return EmailAddress(sanitized)
```

### **3. Property-Based Testing**
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, assume

@given(st.text(min_size=1, max_size=1000))
def test_input_sanitization_properties(malicious_input):
    """Property: No input should bypass sanitization."""
    assume(len(malicious_input.strip()) > 0)
    
    sanitized = sanitize_user_input(malicious_input)
    assert is_safe_for_database(sanitized)
    assert is_safe_for_html_context(sanitized)
    assert len(sanitized) <= len(malicious_input)  # No expansion attacks
```

### **4. Functional Programming Patterns**
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple
from decimal import Decimal

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class User:
    id: UserId
    name: str
    email: EmailAddress
    
    def with_updated_email(self, new_email: EmailAddress) -> 'User':
        """Immutable update pattern - returns new instance."""
        return User(self.id, self.name, new_email)

def calculate_total(items: Tuple[OrderItem, ...], tax_rate: Decimal) -> Amount:
    """Pure function: no side effects, deterministic output."""
    if not items:
        return Amount(Decimal('0'))
    
    subtotal = sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in items)
    return Amount(subtotal * (Decimal('1') + tax_rate))
```

**Integration Strategy:**
1. **Type Foundation** → Branded types and protocol definitions
2. **Contract Layer** → Preconditions, postconditions, invariants
3. **Defensive Implementation** → Input validation and security checks
4. **Pure Function Design** → Separate business logic from side effects
5. **Property Verification** → Test behavior across input ranges
