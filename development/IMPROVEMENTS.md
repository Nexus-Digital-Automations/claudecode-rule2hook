# claudecode-rule2hook Improvements Documentation

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive improvements made to handle complex rule clashes and enhance shell script error handling in the claudecode-rule2hook project.

## 1. Pre-Merge Validation for Complex Rule Clashes

### Problem
When multiple rules target the same event and matcher combination, a simple merge could overwrite existing hooks, leading to unexpected behavior and lost functionality.

### Solution: Enhanced validate-hooks.py

The `validate-hooks.py` script now supports a **dual-mode operation**:

#### Mode 1: Standard Validation
```bash
python3 validate-hooks.py <path_to_hooks.json>
```
- Validates JSON structure
- Checks for required fields
- Displays hooks summary

#### Mode 2: Pre-Merge Conflict Detection
```bash
python3 validate-hooks.py <existing_hooks.json> <new_hook_fragment.json>
```
- Simulates merge operation
- Detects conflicts for identical event/matcher pairs
- Prevents accidental overwrites

### Implementation Details

The `detect_merge_conflicts` function:
1. Builds a mapping of existing event/matcher combinations
2. Checks new hooks against existing mappings
3. Reports specific conflicts with detailed information
4. Returns success/failure status for scripting integration

### Example Conflict Detection Output
```
üî¨ Performing pre-merge validation...
  - Existing Hooks: /home/user/.claude/hooks.json
  - New Hooks: new_rules.json

üö® CONFLICT DETECTED in event 'PostToolUse' for matcher 'Edit':
  - Existing command: "black {file_path}"
  - New conflicting command: "autopep8 {file_path}"
  - Aborting merge to prevent overwriting the existing hook.

‚ùå Merge conflict detected. Aborting.
```

## 2. Enhanced Shell Script Error Handling

### Problem
The original `quick-test.sh` relied on manual observation of errors and could continue execution even after failures, potentially leaving the system in an inconsistent state.

### Solution: Robust quick-test.sh

The enhanced script implements professional shell scripting best practices:

#### Key Improvements

1. **Strict Error Handling**
   ```bash
   set -e  # Exit on any command failure
   set -u  # Exit on undefined variable usage
   set -o pipefail  # Fail on pipe command errors
   ```

2. **Automatic Cleanup with Trap**
   ```bash
   trap cleanup EXIT
   ```
   - Guarantees cleanup runs regardless of exit reason
   - Restores original hooks on failure
   - Removes temporary files

3. **Automated Validation**
   - Each test automatically validates expected outcomes
   - Uses `grep` to verify command fragments in hooks file
   - Fails fast on first error with clear messaging

4. **Structured Functions**
   - `run_test()`: Executes individual test with validation
   - `validate_json()`: Ensures JSON integrity
   - `display_hooks_summary()`: Shows current hook status
   - `cleanup()`: Handles restoration and cleanup

5. **Prerequisite Checks**
   - Verifies Python 3 availability
   - Checks for required validation script
   - Ensures proper directory context

6. **Conflict Detection Test**
   - Creates synthetic conflict scenario
   - Validates that conflict detection works correctly
   - Removes test artifacts automatically

### Test Flow Example

```
‚ñ∂Ô∏è  TEST: Python Formatting Rule
   Rule: "Format Python files with black after editing"
   ACTION: Please run the following in Claude Code and press Enter when done:
   /project:rule2hook "Format Python files with black after editing"

   Validating result...
   ‚úì PASSED: Found expected command in hooks file.
```

## 3. Integration Benefits

### Safer Rule Management
- Pre-merge validation prevents accidental hook overwrites
- Clear conflict reporting helps users make informed decisions
- Supports iterative rule development without data loss

### Reliable Testing
- Automated validation catches errors immediately
- Consistent test environment with automatic cleanup
- Clear pass/fail status for CI/CD integration

### Better Developer Experience
- Color-coded output for easy reading
- Detailed error messages pinpoint issues
- Self-documenting test cases

## 4. Usage Recommendations

### For Rule Development
1. Always run pre-merge validation before applying new rules:
   ```bash
   python3 validate-hooks.py ~/.claude/hooks.json new_rules.json
   ```

2. Use the enhanced test script for comprehensive validation:
   ```bash
   ./quick-test.sh
   ```

### For CI/CD Integration
The enhanced scripts now return proper exit codes:
- 0 for success
- 1 for validation failures or conflicts

This enables integration into automated workflows:
```bash
# In CI pipeline
./quick-test.sh || exit 1
```

## 5. Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Merge Strategies**: Add options for different conflict resolution strategies (append, replace, interactive)
2. **Backup Management**: Automatic timestamped backups with rotation
3. **Diff Visualization**: Show visual diff of hook changes
4. **Rule Priority**: Support for rule priorities to handle conflicts automatically

### Extensibility
The modular design allows easy addition of new features:
- Custom validation rules
- Additional test scenarios
- Integration with other Claude Code features
